# Android-Mobile-Bloatware

# ⚠️WARNING⚠️
**I strongly advise you first of all to have everything saved on your phone because each phone reacts differently and therefore your phone can have a BOOTLOOP or the system can become UNSTABLE and therefore you will have to go through a FACTORY RESET from the recovery mode.**

**Description**

This is a massive list of bloatware existing on Android phones mainly for Samsungs but there are also some for Motorola, Huawei & Xiaomi.
As a reminder, I based myself on sources on the net and scans of bloatware found on my phone that runs on One Ui 7 that I recommend you to keep on this version because samsung will surely add more monitoring.
